## üìù Notes and Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- **Platform Priority:** React for cross-platform efficiency
- **Core Features:** Focus on photo upload, route mapping, and video generation
- **Target Users:** Travel content creators and memory keepers
- **Success Metrics:** Emphasize user completion rates and content quality

### Open Questions for Next Phase
- Which specific React UI library to use (Radix UI vs alternatives)?
- Cloud service provider selection (AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure)?
- Video processing approach (client-side vs server-side)?
- Monetization strategy implementation timeline?

### Risk Mitigation Updates
- Technical performance risks addressed through cloud processing strategy
- Market competition risks mitigated by specialized travel content focus
- User adoption risks addressed through beta testing and feedback loops
