## 📝 Notes and Decisions

### Key Decisions Made
- **Platform Priority:** React 19 + Vite for fast development and optimal web performance
- **Core Features:** Focus on photo upload, route mapping, and video generation
- **Target Users:** Travel content creators and memory keepers
- **Success Metrics:** Emphasize user completion rates and content quality
- **Infrastructure Stack:** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS V4 + Zustand + Supabase
- **State Management:** Zustand selected for lightweight, flexible state management
- **Styling Approach:** Tailwind CSS V4 with utility-first approach and brand color integration

### Open Questions for Next Phase
- Cloud service provider selection (AWS vs Google Cloud vs Azure)?
- Video processing approach (client-side vs server-side)?
- Photo processing pipeline architecture (edge computing vs cloud processing)?
- Monetization strategy implementation timeline?

### Risk Mitigation Updates
- Technical performance risks addressed through cloud processing strategy
- Market competition risks mitigated by specialized travel content focus
- User adoption risks addressed through beta testing and feedback loops
